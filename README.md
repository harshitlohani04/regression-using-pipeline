# regression-using-pipeline

This code has been written in google collab notebook.
So what is so special about a regression model that uses RandomForest Regression??

The thing that is special about this code is that it deals with the creation of many pipelines that transform the data and organize the workflow.
This is the advanced version of scikit-learn pipelines. Utilizing different features of scikit-learn I have created this code.

The basic version of pipelines can be found in my other repository that explains the basics of scikit-learn pipeline OR one can also get to know the basics of scikit-learn pipelines from [my medium blog](https://harshitlohani2004.medium.com/enhancing-productivity-in-ml-projects-with-powerful-pipelines-in-python-and-scikit-learn-ec8cbba0c34e).

Thank You!!
